## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the WiredTiger GitHub landing page! WiredTiger is an Open Source project, that is shepherded by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
WiredTiger primarily consists of a Storage Engine implementation, which is used as the default Storage Engine for the
[MongoDB server](https://github.com/mongodb/).

You can find standalone releases of WiredTiger [here](https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/releases)

You can find documentation about the WiredTiger storage engine [here](http://source.wiredtiger.com/)

Feature and bug tracking system is [here](http://source.wiredtiger.com/)

If you are interested in WiredTiger as it exists within MongoDB, it is worth noting that MongoDB packages WiredTiger along with it's releases. Which means
that you are probably looking in the wrong place. Try starting with the [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).

If you have any questions or feedback - the feature/bug tracking system is open, so please raise a ticket, or alternatively email info@wiredtiger.com

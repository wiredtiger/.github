## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the WiredTiger GitHub landing page!

WiredTiger is a production quality, high performance, scalable, NoSQL, Open Source extensible platform for data management.
WiredTiger is developed and maintained by [MongoDB, Inc.](https://www.mongodb.com/), where it is the principle storage engine in the MongoDB database.

WiredTiger supports both row-oriented storage (where all columns of a row are stored together), and column-oriented storage (where
columns are stored in groups, allowing for more efficient access and storage of column subsets).

WiredTiger includes ACID transactions with standard isolation levels and durability at both checkpoint and commit-level granularity.

WiredTiger can be used as a simple key/value store, but also has a complete schema layer, including indices and projections.

You can find standalone releases and pre-built documentation for  WiredTiger [here](http://source.wiredtiger.com/).

The WiredTiger feature and bug tracking system is [here](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/WT).

The WiredTiger community is [here](https://groups.google.com/g/wiredtiger-users).

If you are interested in WiredTiger as it exists within MongoDB, please consult the [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) or open
a [MongoDB SERVER ticket](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER).

If you have questions or feedback, the feature/bug tracking system is open, so please raise a ticket or alternatively email info@wiredtiger.com.
